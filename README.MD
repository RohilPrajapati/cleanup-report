### Run Project using Docker Compose

```bash
# create .docker.env with the help of .example.env


# Note: run this command after build
# create superuser for login credentials 
docker-compose run backend uv run python manage.py createsuperuser

# populate random 50 row data to database
docker-compose run backend uv run python populate_users.py
```

Run all the container
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
- ```up```: Starts all services defined in docker-compose.yml.
- ```--build```: Forces rebuilding images before starting containers.
- Add ```-d``` if you want to run containers in detached/background mode

Once started, your app will be available at:
http://localhost:80

Run all the container
```bash
docker-compose down
```
Stops all running containers.

Removes containers, networks, and default volumes created by docker-compose up.

If you want to also remove images and named volumes, you can use:
```bash
docker-compose down --rmi all -v
```
